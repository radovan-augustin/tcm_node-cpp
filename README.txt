tcm_node-cpp is part of tcm_node.py rewritten to C++, supports iblock backend and
iSCSI over IP frontend. It can run with uClibc++ on embedded devices with OpenWrt.
Utility tcm_node.py is from Linux-IO Target (LIO -TM-) lio-utils (https://github.com/Datera/lio-utils).
tcm_node-cpp is tested with Linux kernel 3.18.8 and with scripts generated from targetcli.
